Client: We are a group of friends who started a business called Textile POD which brings awareness in the city to recycle clothes. We'll find a place and a purpose for your unwanted clothes and this service is absolutely free of cost. 
We are not getting a good response as we expect it to be. So we want to build a website and link all our social media handles to this webpage to advertise our concept.
